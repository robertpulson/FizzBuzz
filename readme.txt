# FizzBuzz

Command line version of the child learning game.
FizzBuzz is a group learning game to teach children about division. Players take it in turns to say numbers starting at 1.
Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced by 'Fizz' and numbers by 5 are replaced by 'Buzz', number divisible by fifteen with 'FizzBuzz'.

The game is playable in the command line and players can enter a name and select a difficulty level.
